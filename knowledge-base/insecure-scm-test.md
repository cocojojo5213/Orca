## 0. QUICK START

High-value paths to probe first (GET or HEAD, respect rate limits):

```http
/.git/HEAD
/.git/config
/.svn/entries
/.svn/wc.db
/.hg/requires
/.bzr/README
/.DS_Store
/.env
```

**Routing note**: quickly probe these paths first; for full recon workflow, load methodology from `recon-methodology.md` before deeper testing.

## 1. GIT EXPOSURE

### Detection

- **`/.git/HEAD`** — valid repo often returns plain text like:

```text
ref: refs/heads/main
```

- **`/.git/config`** — may expose `remote.origin.url`, user identity, or embedded credentials.
- **`/.git/index`**, **`/.git/objects/`** — partial object store access enables reconstruction with the right tools.

### 403 vs 404

- **`404`** — path likely absent or fully blocked at the edge.
- **`403` on `/.git/`** — directory may **exist** but listing is denied; still try direct file URLs:

```http
/.git/HEAD
/.git/config
/.git/logs/HEAD
/.git/refs/heads/main
```

A **403 on the directory** plus **200 on `HEAD`** strongly indicates exposure.

### Recovery tools (open source)

- **`arthaud/git-dumper`** — dumps reachable `.git` tree when individual files are fetchable.
- **`internetwache/GitTools`** — Dumper, Extractor, Finder modules for partial/corrupt dumps.
- **`WangYihang/GitHacker`** — alternative recovery when standard dumpers miss edge cases.

### Key files to prioritize

| Path | Why it matters |
|------|----------------|
| `.git/config` | Remotes, credentials, hooks paths |
| `.git/logs/HEAD` | Commit history, reflog-style leakage |
| `.git/refs/heads/*` | Branch tips, commit SHAs |
| `.git/packed-refs` | Packed branch/tag refs |
| `.git/objects/**` | Object blobs for reconstruction |

---

## 2. SVN EXPOSURE

### Detection

- **SVN before 1.7**: **`/.svn/entries`** — XML or text metadata listing paths and revisions.
- **SVN ≥ 1.7**: **`/.svn/wc.db`** — SQLite working copy database (`PRAGMA table_info` after download).

Example probe:

```http
GET /.svn/entries HTTP/1.1
GET /.svn/wc.db HTTP/1.1
```

### Recovery

- **`anantshri/svn-extractor`** — automated extraction from exposed `.svn`.
- **Manual**: download `wc.db`, query with `sqlite3` for file paths and checksums, then request **`/.svn/pristine/`** blobs if exposed.

---

## 3. MERCURIAL EXPOSURE

### Detection

- **`/.hg/requires`** — small text file listing repository features; confirms Mercurial metadata.

```http
GET /.hg/requires HTTP/1.1
GET /.hg/store/ HTTP/1.1
```

### Recovery

- **`sahildhar/mercurial_source_code_dumper`** — dumps repository when store paths are reachable.

---

## 4. OTHER LEAKS

### Bazaar (Bzr)

- Probe **`/.bzr/README`** and **`/.bzr/branch-format`** for Bazaar metadata.

### macOS `.DS_Store`

- **`/.DS_Store`** can encode directory and filename listings.
- Tools: **`gehaxelt/ds-store`**, **`lijiejie/ds_store_exp`** — parse `.DS_Store` offline.

### Backup and config artifacts

Probe (adjust for app root and naming conventions):

```text
/.env
/backup.zip
/backup.tar.gz
/wwwroot.rar
/backup.sql
/config.php.bak
/.config.php.swp
```

### Web server misconfiguration signal (example: NGINX)

- **`location /.git { deny all; }`** — may return **403** for `/.git/` while still allowing or denying specific subpaths depending on rules.
- **403 on a protected location** can **confirm the route exists**; always distinguish from **404** on non-existent paths.

## 5. DECISION TREE

1. **Probe `/.git/HEAD`** → `ref: refs/heads/` pattern? → run **git-dumper / GitTools / GitHacker**; review `config` and `logs/HEAD` for secrets.
2. **Else probe `/.svn/wc.db` or `entries`** → success? → **svn-extractor** or manual `wc.db` + pristine recovery.
3. **Else probe `/.hg/requires`** → success? → **mercurial dumper**.
4. **Else probe `/.bzr/README`** → Bazaar tooling or manual path walk.
5. **Parallel**: fetch **`/.DS_Store`**, **`/.env`**, common **backup extensions** on app root and parent paths.
6. **Interpret status codes**: **403 on directory** + **200 on specific files** → treat as **high priority** for file-by-file extraction.
7. **Already inside a Git product's web UI** (not the phase of scanning `/.git`): README / issues rendered as HTML, members filling only numeric IDs, clone lists not isolated → route to `xss-test.md` §8 privileged context; **does not replace** the path-leak probes above.

---

## 6. Live Git Products (alongside §1 path leaks; not mutually exclusive)

`/.git/HEAD` is repository files leaking to the public internet. Once inside Gongfeng / GitLab / a self-built Git web UI, the attack surface is still in the business logic:

- README, Wiki, issues, comments: attack as stored XSS; if there is a desktop client, also check whether it renders the same HTML as a privileged page (`xss-test.md` §8)
- Adding members / invitations: sequential `user_id` + bulk writes (`idor-test.md` §4 / §8), not a new bug class
- Clone / repository lists not isolated per user: your repo shows up in the other party's client, just delivering the XSS above

No frontend, only a bare `.git` reachable → still use §1–§5; do not wait around for a client.
